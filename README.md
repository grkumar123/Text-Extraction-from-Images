Text extraction from image is a challenging task. However, we have already some softwares like Tesseract, Easy OCR etc. It is difficult to do it manually to extract exact text and crop that text as image. I have used OpenCV to do this task.

I have already a .json file in which "Bounding-box" for each word coordinates was already given.
